***Break things into their smallest pieces
***Focus on writing reusable code
***Learn TDD before writing any code

Functions:
  - initialize project folder
    - design json file
    - add uuid
    - folder structure (dependent on dockerfile context)
  - start folder syncing (will test w/o docker)
  - add image(s) to projects
  - app will be structured around an array of projects (objects)
    - certain portions will be written to dockdev.json
    - others are in memory only while running
    - need to consider a 'root' level .dockdev folder to store app-level config

- add file watching
- design json file for dockdev folder

- work through the creation of a project folder
  - create dockdev folder and pre-populate with JSON
  - create function to read/write to json file
  - figure out what needs to be stored in the json file

- start the folder watch system
  - need ability to turnoff file watching
  - handle if the root folder name is changed (need new watch)
  - handle multiple project watches simultaneously
  - use closure to avoid getting machine inspect 2x (same for volume)
  - create one watcher and then reference root directory

- closure with Promise
  - put the promise that resolves machine ip, ssh, volume location, etc in closure
  - return a function that requires no parameters, but will rsync after promise resolves
  - need to consider error handling, but otherwise this solution should work great

- questions
  - should you rsync only the file or folder that changed or everything
  - handle when a root folder is renamed (reason to track by project id)
  - assign UUID to each project, have in memory object keyed with these ids
